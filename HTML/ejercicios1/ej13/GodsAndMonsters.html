        <h2>Letra</h2>

        <p>In the land of Gods and Monsters<br>
            I was an angel living in the garden of evil<br>
            Screwed up, scared, doing anything that I needed<br>
            Shining like a fiery beacon</p>
        <p>You got that medicine I need<br>
            Fame, liquor, love, give it to me slowly<br>
            Put your hands on my waist, do it softly<br>
            Me and God, we don't get along<br>
            So now I sing</p>
        <p>No one's gonna take my soul away<br>
            I'm living like Jim Morrison<br>
            Headed towards a fucked up holiday<br>
            Motel sprees, sprees and I'm singing<br>
            "Fuck yeah, give it to me"<br>
            "This is Heaven, what I truly want"<br>
            It's innocence lost<br>
            Innocence lost</p>

        <p>In the land of Gods and Monsters<br>
            I was an angel looking to get fucked hard<br>
            Like a groupie incognito, posing as a real singer<br>
            Life imitates art</p>
            
        <p>You got that medicine I need<br>
            Dope, shoot it up, straight to the heart, please<br>
            I don't really wanna know what's good for me<br>
            God's dead, I said, "Baby, that's alright with me"</p>  
            
        <p>No one's gonna take my soul away<br>
            I'm living like Jim Morrison<br>
            Headed towards a fucked up holiday<br>
            Motel sprees, sprees and I'm singing<br>
            "Fuck yeah, give it to me"<br>
            "This is Heaven, what I truly want"<br>
            It's innocence lost<br>
            Innocence lost</p>

        <p>When you talk, it's like a movie<br>
            And you're making me crazy<br>
            'Cause life imitates art<br>
            If I get a little prettier, can I be your baby?<br>
            You tell me, "Life isn't that hard"</p>
        
        <p>No one's gonna take my soul away<br>
            I'm living like Jim Morrison<br>
            Headed towards a fucked up holiday<br>
            Motel sprees, sprees and I'm singing<br>
            "Fuck yeah, give it to me"<br>
            "This is Heaven, what I truly want"<br>
            It's innocence lost<br>
            Innocence lost</p>
