        <h2>Letra</h2>
        <p>Everybody knows that the dice are loaded<br>
            Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed<br>
            Everybody knows the war is over<br>
            Everybody knows the good guys lost<br>
            Everybody knows the fight was fixed<br>
            The poor stay poor, the rich get rich<br>
            That's how it goes<br>
            Everybody knows</p>
        <p>Everybody knows that the boat is leaking<br>
            Everybody knows that the captain lied<br>
            Everybody got this broken feeling<br>
            Like their father or their dog just died<br>
            Everybody talking to their pockets<br>
            Everybody wants a box of chocolates<br>
            And a long-stem rose<br>
            Everybody knows</p>
        <p>Everybody knows that you love me baby<br>
            Everybody knows that you really do<br>
            Everybody knows that you've been faithful<br>
            Oh, give or take a night or two<br>
            Everybody knows you've been discreet<br>
            But there were so many people you just had to meet<br>
            Without your clothes<br>
            Everybody knows</p>
        <p>Everybody knows, everybody knows<br>
            That's how it goes<br>
            Everybody knows<br>
            Everybody knows, everybody knows<br>
            That's how it goes<br>
            Everybody knows</p>
        <p>And everybody knows that it's now or never<br>
            Everybody knows that it's me or you<br>
            And everybody knows that you live forever<br>
            When you've done a line or two<br>
            Everybody knows the deal is rotten<br>
            Old Black Joe's still picking cotton<br>
            For your ribbons and bows<br>
            And everybody knows</p>
        <p>And everybody knows that the plague is coming<br>
            Everybody knows that it's moving fast<br>
            Everybody knows that the naked man and woman<br>
            Are just a shining artifact of the past<br>
            Everybody knows the scene is dead<br>
            But there's gonna be a meter on your bed<br>
            That will disclose<br>
            What everybody knows</p>
        <p>And everybody knows that you're in trouble<br>
            Everybody knows what you've been through<br>
            From the bloody cross on top of Calvary<br>
            To the beach of Malibu<br>
            Everybody knows it's coming apart<br>
            Take one last look at this Sacred Heart<br>
            Before it blows<br>
            Everybody knows</p>
